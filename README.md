```

## Track your progress

Monitor your breathing journey with detailed statistics:

Your Breathing Stats
            Total sessions: 7
            Total time: 2 minutes
            Favorite pattern: 4-4-4-4 (2 sessions)
            Current streak: 2 days

Use 'breath stats --detailed' for charts and advanced analytics.
```

## Advanced statistics

The `--detailed` flag shows beautiful ASCII charts including:

- **Sessions over last 7 days**: Visual timeline of your daily practice
- **Pattern usage distribution**: See which breathing techniques you use most

```bash
# Detailed view with beautiful ASCII charts
breath stats --detailed
```

## Export your statistics

Export your breathing data for external analysis or backup:

```bash
# Export complete data as JSON
breath export-stats --format json

# Export session data as CSV
breath export-stats --format csv

# Custom output file
breath export-stats --format json --output my_backup.json
```

**CSV Export includes:** Date, Pattern, Cycles, Duration (seconds)

This will guide you through an interactive process to define each phase of your breathing pattern.
